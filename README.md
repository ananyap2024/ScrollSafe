# 🐻🌲 ScrollSafe – Beat Doomscrolling with Pomodoro ⏳

## 📌 Overview

**ScrollSafe** is a productivity app designed to help you break free from **doom scrolling** using the **Pomodoro technique**.

Set a focus timer, stay away from distracting apps, and watch your **animal companion** journey through a lush forest as a visual reward for your focus.
The longer you stay focused, the further your animal travels. If you quit early, your animal stays stuck — a gentle reminder to stay on track.

---

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Set Your Focus Timer** – Choose your Pomodoro duration (e.g., 25 minutes).
2. **Stay Focused** – While the timer runs, avoid using distracting apps.
3. **Watch Your Progress** – Your animal moves forward in the forest as you complete focus sessions.
4. **Break the Streak?** – If you give up early, the animal stops moving.
5. **Track Distance** – The app records how far your animal has traveled across sessions.
